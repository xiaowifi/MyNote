There was once a man in South America who had a parrot (鹦鹉)， a pet bird that could imitate (模拟)human speech. The parrot was unique. There was no other bird like him in the while world. He could lean to say any word except one. He could not say the name of his native town, Cotano. The man did everything he could to teach the parrot to say “Cotano” but he never succeeded. At first he was very gentle with the bird, but gradually he lost his temper. “You stupid bird! Why can’t you learn to say that one word! Say Cotano or I’ll like you!”  But the parrot would not say it. Many times the man screamed (大声叫)，“Say Cotano or I’ll kill you!” But the bird would never repeat the name. Finally the man gave up. He picked up the parrot and threw him into the chicken house. “You are even more stupid than the chickens!”
In the chicken house, there were four old chickens waiting to be killed for Sunday’s dinner. The next morning, when he went out to the chicken house, the man opened the door. He was shocked by what he saw. He could not believe his eyes and ears. On the floor lay three dead chickens, the parrot was screaming at the fourth, “Say Catano or I’ll kill you!”.

Started in 1636, Harvard University is the oldest of all the many colleges and universities in the United States. Yale, Princeton, Columbia and Dartmouth were opened soon after Harvard.
In the early years, these schools were much alike. Only young men went to college. All the students studied the same subjects, and everyone learned Latin, Greek and Hebrew. Little was known about science then, and one kind of school could teach everything that was known about the world. When the students graduated, most of them become ministers or teachers.
In 1782, Harvard stared a medical school for young men who wanted to become doctors. Later lawyers could receive their training in Harvard’s low school. In 1825, besides Latin and Greek, Havard began teaching modern languages, such as French and German. Soon it began teaching American history. 
As knowledge increased, Havard and other colleges began to teach many new subjects. Students were allowed to choose the subjects that interests them.
Today, there are many different kinds of colleges and universities. Most of them are made up of smaller schools that deal with special fields of learning. There’s so much to learn that one kind of school can’t offer it all.

You will find many strange animals in the sea. Some are like a school bus. Many sea animals give out light in the dark and some have sharp teeth.
During the day, there is enough light. Here, under the sea, everything is blue and green. When fish swim nearby, you can catch them, with your hands. When you have bottles of air on your back, you can stay in deep water for a long time. However, you can’t dive too deep. And you must be very careful when you dive in deep water. 
The deep sea is not an easy place to live in. It is cold, and it is dark, too. The deeper it is, the less sunlight there is. About 3000 feet, there is no light at all. It is very dark in the sea. Many fishes have no eyes. Some have big eyes. A few have eyes on one side. 
Besides, the coldness and the darkness, deep-sea animals face a third danger-other animals.
Animals eat! They must find food to eat. Many animals eat plants. However, some animals eat meat. This means these sea animals have two big jobs. They need to find animals as food, and they have to try not to become other animal’s meal.

### 英语正文
Three man traveling on a train began a conversation about the world’s greatest wonders.
“In my opinion,” the first man said, “the Egyptian pyramids” are the world’s greatest wonder. Although they were built thousands of years ago, they are still standing. And remember: the people who built them had only simple tools. They did not have the kind of machinery that builders and engineers have today.”
“ I agree that the pyramids in Egypt are wonderful,” the second man said,” But I don’t think they are the greatest wonder. I believe computers are more wonderful than the pyramids. They are taken people to the moon and brought them back safely. In seconds, they carry out mathematical calculations that would take a person a hundred years to do.”
He turned to the third man and asked, “What do you think is the greatest wonder in world?”
The third man thought for a long time, and then he said, “Well, I agree that the pyramids are wonderful, and I agree that computers are wonderful, too. However, in my opinion, the most wonderful thing in the world is this thermos.”
And he took a thermos out of his bag and held it up.
The other two men were very surprised. “A thermos?” they exclaimed. “But that’s a simple thing.”
“Oh, no, it’s not,” the third man said. “In the winter you put in a hot drink and it says hot. In the summer you put in a cold drink and it stays cold. How does the thermos know whether it’s winter or summer?”

There was once an ant that was very thirsty.
 It ran here and there looking for some water but could not find any.
Then suddenly, when the ant was almost ready to die of thirst, a large drop of water fell on it.
The ant drank the water, which saved its life.
The water was actually a tear from a young girl who was crying. Because of her sadness, the tear had magical qualities and suddenly the ant could speak the language of human beings.
The ant looked up and saw the young girl sitting in front of a huge pile of seeds.
"Why are you sad?" asked the ant.
 "I'm the prisoner of a giant." the girl told the ant. "He won't let me go until I've made three separate heaps of grain, barley（大麦）and rye（黑麦）out of this huge pile of seeds in which they are all mixed together."
"That will take you a month!" the ant said, looking at the huge pile of seeds.
 "I know," the girl cried, "and if I haven't finished by tomorrow, the giant will eat me for his supper!"
 "Don't cry," the ant said, "my friends and I will help you."
 Soon thousands of ants were at work, separating the three kinds of seeds.
 The next morning, when the giant saw that the work had been done, he let the girl go. 
 Thus it was one of her tears that saved her life.

No one is glad to hear that his body has to be cut open by a surgeon and part of it taken out. Today, however, we needn’t worry about feeling pain during the operation. The sick person falls into a kind of sleep, and when he awakes, the operation is finished. But these happy conditions are fairly new. It is not many years since a man who had to have operation felt all in its pain.
Long ago, operation has usually to be done while the sick man could feel everything. Sooner after 1770, Joseph Priestley discovered a gas which is now called “laughing gas”. Laughing as became known in America. Young men and women went to parties to try it. Most of them spent their time laughing, but one man at a party, Horace Wells, noticed that people didn’t seem to feel pain when they were using this gas. He decided to make an experiment on himself. He asked a friend to help him.
Wells took some of the gas, and his friend pulled out one of Well’s teeth. Wells felt no pain at all. 
As he didn’t know enough about laughing gas, he gave a man less gas than he should have. The man cried out with pain when his tooth was being pulled out.
Wells tried again, but this time he gave too much of the gas, and the man died. Wells never forgot this terrible event.

很久以前，手术都是在病人完全清醒的时候做的。在1770过后不久，约瑟夫. 普利斯特发现了一种气体现在被称作“令人笑的气”。 笑气被美国人知道了。年轻人们都去舞会上体验这种气体。他们大部分人都哈哈大笑，但是一次一个宴会上的人，霍尔斯.威尔士发现当人们使用这种气体的时候就不会感觉到疼痛。他决定在自己身上做个试验。他邀请了一位朋友帮他。 
威尔士取出一些气体，然后他的朋友拔出他的一颗牙。威尔士一点也没有感觉到痛。
因为他对笑气了解不多，他在另一个人身上试验时，用的笑气的量小于应用的量， 所以当这个人的牙齿被拔出时，他痛苦的大喊大叫。
威尔士又试了一次，但是这次他用的笑气的量太多，导致这个人死了威尔士永远也忘不了这个可怕的经历。

One day a few children asked him to tell them something about the animals in Africa. He told them how he fought with the tigers and elephants. His stories surprised them all and some policemen and workers went to listen to him. It made him happier. Just a man who taught geography in a middle school passed there. He stopped to listen to him for a while and then said, "Could you please tell us a rare animal, sir?"
"Certainly," said Mr. Turner. "One day I met a rhinoceros（犀牛） by a river…"

If you travel by air across the center of Africa or South America, you fly over forests for thousands of kilometers. These great forests are the oceans of trees. There are thousands and thousands of different kinds of plants and animals.
 However, the world's forests are getting smaller all the time. We are cutting down the trees because we need wood, and we need more farmland. Some people say that there will not be any forests like these in 20 or 30 years. What will happen if they disappear?
If we cut down our forests, a lot of plants and animals will disappear from the world. In a lot of places the new farmland will soon look like the old deserts. Crops will not grow there. It will not rain very often, and the weather will get very hot. Perhaps the climate of the world will change. This will be dangerous for everyone in the world. That is why we must take care of our forests.

如果我们砍掉了我们的森林，大量的动植物就会从这个世界上消失。很多地方很快就会沙化看起来像是沙漠。庄稼也长不起来。降雨也会变少，天气会变得异常炎热。或许世界气候自此就变了。这对世界上的每个人来说都是威胁。那就是为什么我们要保护好我们的森林。

Martin Luther King was a black minister, who became a great leader of the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s.
King was born on January 15, 1929 in Atlanta, Georgia. When he was young, he was strongly influenced by Thoreau and Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi's idea of non-violent resistance. Having received a Ph. D (Doctor of Philosophy) from Boston University, he became a political and religious leader of the non-violent civil relights movement in 1955. On August 28, 1963, he led over 250,000 Americans on a march in Washington D.C. to fight for the Civil Rights Law to guarantee equality for all people, and delivered his best known speech "I Have a Dream" before the Lincoln Memorial. The "dream" is a dream of brotherly love and equality for the Black and White. Thus, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for peace in 1964, but he was murdered four years later.
Though he died, he was greatly respected and loved by the Americans, both the white and the black. By vote of Congress in 1968, the third Monday of every January is now a federal holiday in Luther King's honor. He lives in people's hearts forever.

King Louis XIV tried to control the national parliament and raise more taxes. But his effort failed. He ordered his troops to Versailles. The people thought that Louis intended to put down the Revolution by force. On July 14,1789, they stormed and took the Bastille, where political prisoners were kept. Ever since that day, July 14 has been the French National Day. Louis tried to flee the country in 1792 to get support from Austria and Prussia. However, he was caught and put in prison. In September 1792, the monarchy was abolished. In the same year, Louis was executed. A few months later his wife, Marie also had her head cut off. The Revolution of France had frightened the other kings of Europe. Armies from Austria and Prussia began to march against France. The French raised republican armies to defend the nation.

### 英语正文
A foreigner’s first impression of the U.S. is likely to be that everyone is in a rush-often under pressure. City people appear always to be hurrying to get where they are going restlessly, seeking attention in a store, and elbowing others as they try to complete their errands （任务）. Racing through daytime meals is part of the pace of life in this country.
Working time is considered precious. Others in public eating places are waiting for you to finish so that they too can be served and get back to work within the time allowed. Each person hurries to make room for the next person. If you don’t, waiters will hurry you.
You also find drivers will be abrupt and that people will push past you. You will miss smiles, brief conversations, and small courtesies with strangers. Don’t take it personally. This is because people value time highly, and they resent someone else “wasting” it beyond a certain courtesy point.
The view of time affects the importance we attach to patience. In the American system of values, patience is not a high priority. Many of us have what might be called “a short fuse.” We begin to move restlessly about if we feel time is slipping away without some returnbe this in terms of pleasure, work value, or rest. Those coming from lands where time is looked upon differently may find this matter of pace to be one of their most difficult adjustments in both business and daily life.
Many newcomers to the States will miss the opening courtesy of a business call, for example, they will miss the ritual socializing that goes with a welcoming cup of tea or coffee they may be traditional in their own country. They may miss leisurely business chats in a café or coffeehouse. Normally, Americans do not assess their visitors in such relaxed surroundings over prolonged small talks. We seek out evidence of past performance rather than evaluate a business colleague through social courtesies. Since we generally assess and probe professionally rather than socially, we start talking business very quickly. (348 words)

### 中文翻译
一个外国人对于美国的第一印象很有可能是每个人都在压力下匆匆忙忙。城市里的人总是表现得匆匆忙忙不知疲倦的，为了尽快做完一件事情，他们会在店里拼命引起店员的注意或者用胳膊肘推搡别人。白天匆忙就餐也是这个国家生活节奏的一个部分。
工作时间被认为是很珍贵的。在一些公共饮食场所，其他人会等在你旁边等你吃完，这样大家都可以得到服务，并赶在规定的时间内回去工作。每个人都会尽快给下一个人腾出地方。如果你不这样，侍者会催促你的。
你会发现司机也都很匆忙，人们从你身边匆匆走过。你会错过一些微笑，简短的交谈和一些与陌生人的小礼节。不要在意，这是因为他们非常珍惜时间，而且他们认为一旦太注重这些社交礼节就是浪费时间。
对时间的观念还会影响到我们对耐心的理解。在美国价值体系中，耐心并不是首要考虑的。我们中的很多人被称为“脾气火爆”。如果我们觉得时间在毫无意义的溜走，既没有娱乐价值，工作价值，也不在休息，那就会开始不停地徘徊。那些来自时间观念不同的国家的人发现他们在商业和日常生活中最困难的就是对时间节奏的适应。
许多刚到美国来的人都会想念他们在商业会谈中一些开场礼节。举个例子，他们会想念欢迎你到来而泡的一杯茶或咖啡这样的社交礼仪，这在他们国家是常规礼仪。他们会想念在咖啡屋悠闲的会谈。而通常，美国人不会与来访者在这么悠闲的环境中进行一些冗长的小会谈。对于同事，我们总是看他过去的表现而不是与他的社交礼仪。因为我们一般都是更注重专业性的，而不是社交性的，因此我们总是很快进入正题。
