> Taking away a city's rubbish is a big job. Every day trucks come into a city to collect it. Most rubbish is made up of things we can't eat or use. If we kept these things, we would soon have a mountain of rubbish.
  In some cities the rubbish is collected and taken outside the city to a dump. Often the city dump is placed where the ground is low or there is a big hole. The kitchen rubbish is broken into small pieces and sent into the sewage（污水，排水）system. The sewage system takes away the used water from toilets, bathtubs and other places.
  To keep mice and flies away, some earth is used to cover the newly dumped rubbish. Later, grass may be planted on the rubbish-filled land. Finally, a house or a school may be built there, and then you'd never know that this had once been an old rubbish dump.
  In other cities the rubbish is burnt in special places. The fire burns everything except the metal.Sometimes the metal can be used again in factories where things are made of metal. The food parts of rubbish are put in special piles where they slowly change into something called humus（腐殖质）, which looks like black earth. It is rich with the kinds of things that feed plants and help make them grow. 

> 拿走城市的垃圾是一项艰巨的任务。每天都有卡车进城取货。大多数垃圾是由我们无法食用或使用的东西组成的。如果我们保留这些东西，我们很快就会有一大堆垃圾。在一些城市，垃圾被收集并带到城市外的垃圾场。通常，城市垃圾场放置在地面低或有大洞的地方。厨房垃圾被切成小块，然后送入下水道系统。污水处理系统将厕所，浴缸和其他地方的用过的水带走。为了让老鼠和苍蝇远离，使用了一些泥土来覆盖新倾倒的垃圾。之后，可以在垃圾堆满的土地上种草。最后，在那里可能会盖房子或学校，然后您永远不会知道这曾经是一个旧的垃圾场。在其他城市，垃圾在特殊的地方燃烧。大火会燃烧除金属以外的所有东西。有时，金属可以在由金属制成的工厂中再次使用。将垃圾的食物部分放入特殊的堆中，然后慢慢地变成叫做腐殖质的东西，看起来像黑土。它富含各种植物所需的养料，有助于植物生长。

> When John and Victoria Falls arrived in New York City for one-year stay, they did not bring very many things with them. They had planned either to live in a furnished apartment or to buy used furniture. But they soon learned about a new system that more and more people are using. The renting of home furnishings (bed, tables, dishes, and so on) has become one of America’s fastest growing businesses.
  What kinds of people rent their home furnishings instead of buying them? People who are international business or government officials, foreign students, airline workers, young married couples - people whose job or business may force them to move frequently from one city to another. They save a lot of trouble and the cost of moving their furniture each time. They simply rent new furniture when they reach their new homes. Young people with little money do not want to buy cheap furniture that they may soon dislike. They prefer to wait until they have enough money to buy furniture they really like. Meanwhile, they find they can rent better quality furniture than they could afford to buy.
  One family, who now have a large, beautiful home of their own, liked their rented furniture so much that they decided to keep renting it instead of buying new things. But usually people don’t like to tell others about it. The idea of renting home furnishings is still quite new, and they are not sure what their neighbors might think. 

> 当约翰和维多利亚瀑布到达纽约市居住一年时，他们并没有带来很多东西。他们曾计划住在带家具的公寓里或购买用过的家具。但是他们很快就了解了越来越多的人正在使用的新系统。租用家具（床，桌子，餐具等）已成为美国发展最快的业务之一。什么样的人出租而不是购买房屋家具？是国际企业或政府官员，外国学生，航空工作者，年轻的已婚夫妇的人，这些人的工作或业务可能迫使他们经常从一个城市搬到另一个城市。他们节省了很多麻烦，并节省了每次移动家具的费用。他们到达新家时只是租用新家具。没钱的年轻人不想购买他们可能很快会讨厌的廉价家具。他们宁愿等到有足够的钱来购买他们真正喜欢的家具。同时，他们发现他们可以租用质量比买得起的家具。一个家庭现在拥有一个自己的大而美丽的房屋，非常喜欢自己租用的家具，以至于他们决定继续租用家具而不是购买新东西。但是通常人们不喜欢告诉别人。租用家具的想法还很新，他们不确定邻居会怎么想。

* Renting home furnishings 租用家具
* Because it saves them much trouble and money 因为这为他们节省了很多麻烦和金钱
* Renting furniture is not popular in the couple’s home town 在这对夫妇的家乡，租家具不受欢迎
* A New Way of Getting Home Furnishings  一种新的家居摆设方式
* they don’t have much money and don’t want to buy the cheap furniture 他们没有很多钱，也不想买便宜的家具

> I have been in London for two weeks. I don't speak English well at all. I have great difficulty in understanding people. In fact I don't catch a thing they say. I find their pronunciation is too strange for me to understand, and they speak  so fast that I can't keep up with them. When I am on a bus, I ask the conductor something. He answers, but I don't understand. So he says it slowly in a high  voice, I still don't understand it. Then he gets angry and goes away.
  But I haven't lost heart. I still enjoy speaking  English. I must keep on working hard  at it. I believe I'll speak English well soon.
