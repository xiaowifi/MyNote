> Six people were travelling in a compartment（包厢） on a train. Five of them were quiet and well behaved, but the sixth was a rude young man who was causing a lot of trouble to the other passengers.
  At a station this young man got out with his two heavy bags. None of the other passengers helped him, but one of them waited until the rude young man was very far away. Then he opened the window and shouted to the young man, "You left something behind in the compartment!" Then he closed the windows again.
  The young man turned around and hurried back with his two bags. He was very tired when he arrived, but he shouted through the window, "What did I leave behind?"
  As the train began to move again, the passenger who had called him back opened the window and said, "A very bad impression!"

> When John and Victoria Falls arrived in New York City for one-year stay, they did not bring very many things with them. They had planned either to live in a furnished apartment or to buy used furniture. But they soon learned about a new system that more and more people are using. The renting of home furnishings (bed, tables, dishes, and so on) has become one of America’s fastest growing businesses.
  What kinds of people rent their home furnishings instead of buying them? People who are international business or government officials, foreign students, airline workers, young married couples - people whose job or business may force them to move frequently from one city to another. They save a lot of trouble and the cost of moving their furniture each time. They simply rent new furniture when they reach their new homes. Young people with little money do not want to buy cheap furniture that they may soon dislike. They prefer to wait until they have enough money to buy furniture they really like. Meanwhile, they find they can rent better quality furniture than they could afford to buy.
  One family, who now have a large, beautiful home of their own, liked their rented furniture so much that they decided to keep renting it instead of buying new things. But usually people don’t like to tell others about it. The idea of renting home furnishings is still quite new, and they are not sure what their neighbors might think. 

> 当约翰和维多利亚瀑布到达纽约市居住一年时，他们并没有带来很多东西。他们曾计划住在带家具的公寓里或购买用过的家具。但是他们很快就了解了越来越多的人正在使用的新系统。租用家具（床，桌子，餐具等）已成为美国发展最快的业务之一。什么样的人出租而不是购买房屋家具？是国际企业或政府官员，外国学生，航空工作者，年轻的已婚夫妇的人，这些人的工作或业务可能迫使他们经常从一个城市搬到另一个城市。他们节省了很多麻烦，并节省了每次移动家具的费用。他们到达新家时只是租用新家具。没钱的年轻人不想购买他们可能很快会讨厌的廉价家具。他们宁愿等到有足够的钱来购买他们真正喜欢的家具。同时，他们发现他们可以租用质量比买得起的家具。一个家庭现在拥有一个自己的大而美丽的房屋，非常喜欢自己租用的家具，以至于他们决定继续租用家具而不是购买新东西。但是通常人们不喜欢告诉别人。租用家具的想法还很新，他们不确定邻居会怎么想。

* Renting home furnishings. 租用家具。
* Because it saves them much trouble and money 因为这为他们节省了很多麻烦和金钱
* Renting furniture is not popular in the couple’s home town 在这对夫妇的家乡，租家具不受欢迎
* A New Way of Getting Home Furnishings 一种新的家居摆设方式
* they don’t have much money and don’t want to buy the cheap furniture  他们没有很多钱，也不想买便宜的家具

> Many people have to work at weekends. Some people do not mind, others think it is terrible.
  One man thinks that working at weekends can be dangerous. He is George Smith. Mr. Smith works in an office, in Brighton, England.
  On Saturday, May 24, 1986, he went to the office to do some work. After he got into the lift, it stopped between floors. Mr. Smith could not get out of the lift. He began to shout, but no one heard him. Then Mr. Smith remembered that it was a holiday in England. No one was going to come to work until Tuesday.
  There was nothing for Mr. Smith to do. He had to wait until one of his workmates came to work and found him. With nothing to eat or drink, Mr. Smith was very hungry and had to sleep most of the time.
  Early on Tuesday morning, one of his workmates came into work and found the lift was not working. When the lift was opened, Mr. Smith came out cold, weak, and tired. He had been in the lift for over 60 hours!
  Now Mr. Smith says, "I only use the lift if they have  telephones in them."
