> Elvis Aron Presley, often called “the king of rock music”, died on August 16th, 1977, at the age of forty-two. He left a great influence on popular music, and millions of fans. During his lifetime, Elvis sold more than four hundred million records. After Presley died, many of his records rose quickly. When Presley died, many mourners journeyed to Memphis, Tennessee, Presley's home, to pay their last respects. While most of these fans knew a lot about the songs of Elvis, few of them knew the story of how Elvis had his first record which was for his mother. He paid four dollars to a small Memphis recording shop, and recorded two songs. The songs were “My Happiness” and “That's Where Your Heartaches Begin”. Sam Philips, who owned the shop where Elvis made the record, liked Presley's songs. He said he would call him some day. About a year later, Philips did call and asked him to cut a record. This first record had “Blue Moon of Kentucky”on one side, and “That's All Right, Mama”on the other.

> 埃尔维斯·阿隆·普雷斯利（Elvis Aron Presley）通常被称为“摇滚音乐之王”，于1977年8月16日去世，享年42岁。他对流行音乐和数百万的粉丝产生了巨大的影响。猫王一生中售出了四亿多张唱片。普雷斯利去世后，他的许多记录迅速上升。普雷斯利去世后，许多送葬者前往普雷斯利的家乡田纳西州的孟菲斯，表示敬意。尽管大多数歌迷对猫王的歌曲了解很多，但很少有人知道猫王如何为母亲献唱的故事。他花了4美元在一家小孟菲斯唱片店里，录制了两首歌。歌曲是“我的幸福”和“那是您开始心痛的地方”。埃尔维斯（Elvis）所在唱片店的老板山姆·菲利普（Sam Philips）喜欢普雷斯利的歌曲。他说他有一天会打电话给他。大约一年后，飞利浦打电话给他，要求他记录下来。第一张唱片的一面是“肯塔基州的蓝月亮”，另一面是“妈妈，没关系”。

> Once James Thornhill, a famous English painter, was asked to paint some pictures on the walls of the king's palace in England.
  Then workers were sent for and a big platform（台子）was made.
  With the help of a worker, Thornhill started painting on the platform. They worked for a whole year and at last the pictures were ready.
  Thornhill was happy when he looked at the pictures, for they were really beautiful. He looked at them for a long time, and then took one step back and looked again. Now the pictures were even more beautiful. He took another step, then another. Finally he was at the very edge of the platform, but he didn't know it because he was thinking of his pictures.
  The worker saw everything. "What should I do?" he thought. "Thornhill was at the very edge of the platform. If I cry out, he will take another step, fall off it and surely be killed. "So the worker quickly took some paint（漆）and threw it at the pictures.
  "What are you doing?" cried the painter, running quickly forward to his pictures.

> I have been in London for two weeks. I don't speak English well at all. I have great difficulty in understanding people. In fact I don't catch a thing they say. I find their pronunciation is too strange for me to understand, and they speak so fast that I can't keep up with them. When I am on a bus, I ask the conductor something. He answers, but I don't understand. So he says it slowly in a high voice, I still don't understand it. Then he gets angry and goes away.
