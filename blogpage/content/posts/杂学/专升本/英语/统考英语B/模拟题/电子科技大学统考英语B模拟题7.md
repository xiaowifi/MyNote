> The Antarctic（南极洲） is actually a desert. It is the only continent on the earth without a river or a lake.
  The Antarctic is all ice all year round. The warmest temperature ever recorded there is zero, at the South Pole. Explorers used to think that a place so cold would have a heavy snowfall. But less than ten inches of snow falls each year. That is less than half an inch of water. Ten times that much moisture falls in parts of the Sahara.
  The little snow that falls in Antarctic never melts. It continues to pile up deeper and deeper year after year. When the snow gets to be about eighty feet deep it is turned to ice by the weight of the snow above it

> 南极洲实际上是一片沙漠。它是地球上唯一没有河流或湖泊的大陆。南极终年都是冰。在南极，有记录以来最温暖的温度为零。探险家曾经认为，这么冷的地方会下大雪。但是每年降雪少于十英寸。那是不到半英寸的水。撒哈拉沙漠部分地区的水分流失是其的十倍。落在南极的小雪永远不会融化。年复一年，它继续堆积越来越深。当积雪达到约八十英尺深时，它被上方的积雪重压成冰

* (T) Antarctica is called a desert because it has little moisture and no lakes or rivers. 南极洲被称为沙漠，因为它几乎没有水分，也没有湖泊或河流。
* (F) The Antarctic has ten times as much moisture as the Sahara 南极的水分是撒哈拉沙漠的十倍
* (F) The temperature in the Antarctic is always above zero 南极的温度始终高于零
* (T) The snow in Antarctic is very deep because it piles up year after year 南极的雪很深，因为它年年积雪
* (T) The snow turns to ice when the snow above it is heavy enough 当上面的雪足够大时，雪变成冰

> Many people who work in London prefer to live outside it, and to go in to their offices or schools every day by train, car or bus, even though this means they have to get up early in the morning and reach home late in the evening.  
  One advantage of living outside London is that houses are cheaper. Even a small flat in London without a garden costs quite a lot to rent. With the same money, one can get a little house in the country with a garden of one’s own.  
  Then, in the country one can really get away from the noise and hurry of busy working lives. Even though one has to get up earlier and spend more time in trains or buses, one can sleep better at night and during weekends and on summer evenings, one can enjoy the fresh, clean air of the country. If one likes gardens, one can spend one’s free time digging, planting, watering and doing the hundred and one other jobs which are needed in a garden. Then, when the flowers and vegetables come up, one has got the reward together with those who have shared the secret of Nature.  
  Some people, however, take no interest in country things: for them, happiness lies in the town, with its cinemas and theatres, beautiful shops and busy streets, dance-halls and restaurants. Such people would feel that their life was not worth living if they had to live it outside London. An occasional walk in one of the parks and a fortnight’s (two weeks) visit to the sea every summer is all the country they want: the rest they are quite prepared to leave to those who are glad to get away from London every night. 

> 许多在伦敦工作的人都喜欢住在伦敦以外的地方，每天都坐火车，汽车或公共汽车去办公室或学校，尽管这意味着他们必须清晨起床并在深夜回家。 。在伦敦以外居住的好处之一是房屋便宜。即使是伦敦没有花园的小公寓，租金也要高很多。只要用同样的钱，就可以在乡间拥有自己的花园的小房子。这样，在该国，人们便可以真正摆脱繁忙的工作环境中的喧嚣和匆忙。即使一个人必须早起，花更多的时间在火车或公共汽车上，一个人在晚上，周末和夏天的夜晚可以睡得更好，一个人可以享受这个国家清新的空气。如果您喜欢花园，则可以将自己的空闲时间花在挖，种，浇水上，以及完成花园中所需的一百一项工作。然后，当鲜花和蔬菜升起时，人们便与那些分享大自然秘密的人们一起获得了回报。但是，有些人对乡村事物不感兴趣：对他们而言，幸福在于镇上，那里有电影院和剧院，漂亮的商店和繁忙的街道，舞厅和餐馆。这样的人会觉得，如果不得不在伦敦以外的地方生活，那是不值得的。每年夏天，偶尔去其中一个公园散步，两周（两个星期）到海边逛逛，便是他们想要的整个国家：其余的游客准备好离开，准备每天晚上离开伦敦的人。
* People who work in London prefer to live in the country 在伦敦工作的人更喜欢住在这个国家
* renting a small flat without a garden 租一个没有花园的小公寓
* having spent time working in the garden 花时间在花园里工作
* their life was meaningless 他们的生活毫无意义
* escape from 从...逃脱

> A miser（守财奴）sold all that he had and bought a lump of gold, which he buried in a hole in the ground by the side of an old wall and went to look at daily. One of his workmen observed his frequent visits to the spot and decided to watch his movements. He soon discovered the secret of the hidden treasure, came to the lump of gold, and stole it. The Miser, on his next visit, found the hole empty and began to tear his hair and to cry. A neighbor, seeing him overcome with grief（悲伤）and learning the cause, said, “Go and take a stone, and place it in the hole, and fancy that the gold is still lying there. It will do you quite the same service; for when the gold was there, you did not make the slightest use of it.”

Just as lots of young people take to pop music, I love basketball. It’s part of my life. I began to play basketball in my childhood. I still remember the good old days when I played with my classmates after school. Later on, as I grew up, almost everything changed, but this sport - playing basketball remained and my love of it grew even stronger.I love this sport because it brings joys and health to my life. When I get tired from office work, I go to the sports ground and I will feel refreshed. It is basketball that keeps me in good shape and mood.
