> Modern life is impossible without traveling. The fastest way of traveling is by plane. With a modern airliner you can travel in one day to places which it takes a month or more to get to a hundred years ago. 
  Traveling by train is slower than by plane, but it has its advantages. You can see the country when you are traveling through. Modern trains have comfortable seats and dining-cars. They make even the longest journey enjoyable. 
  Some people prefer to travel by sea when possible. There are large liners and river boats. You can visit many other countries and different parts of your country on them. Ships are not so fast as trains or planes, but traveling by sea is a very pleasant way to spend a holiday.
  Many people like to travel by car. You can make your own timetable. You can travel three or four hundred miles or only fifty or one hundred miles a day, just as you like. You can stop wherever you wish - where there is something interesting to see, at a good restaurant where you can enjoy a good meat, or at a hotel to spend the night. That is why traveling by car is popular for pleasure trips, while people usually take a train or plane when they are traveling on business.

> 没有旅行，现代生活是不可能的。最快的旅行方式是乘飞机。使用现代客机，您可以一日游到一百年前需要一个月或更长时间的地方。坐火车比坐飞机慢，但有其优点。您可以在旅行时看到国家/地区。现代火车有舒适的座位和餐车。他们使最长的旅程都变得愉快。有些人喜欢在可能的情况下乘船旅行。有大班轮和河船。您可以访问许多其他国家和您所在国家的不同地区。船速不如火车或飞机，但海上旅行是度过假期的一种非常愉快的方式。许多人喜欢乘汽车旅行。您可以自己制定时间表。您可以随意行驶三，四百英里，或者每天仅五十或一百英里。您可以随时随地停下来-在有趣的景点看到的东西，可以在美味的肉类的高档餐厅用餐，或在酒店过夜。这就是为什么乘汽车旅行在休闲旅行中很受欢迎，而人们在出差时通常会乘火车或飞机。

* (T) From the passage, we know the fastest way of traveling is by plane  从段落中我们知道最快的旅行方式是乘飞机

> Morgan Rees has always been a good businessman. He used to own three petrol stations and was busy most of the time. When he was 65, the normal retirement age, he decided that he didn't want to stop, so he carried on working for another two years. Eventually, when he was nearly 68, his wife, Dolly, asked him to retire because she wanted to enjoy their old age together. Reluctantly, he handed over the business to his son.
  But he was unhappy. He didn't know what to do with himself. Although he read a lot of books and he went on holiday to interesting places with his wife, he was bored and began to get depressed because he hated being retired.
  Then one day he saw an advertisement in the newspaper and, without telling his wife, he bought a small crockery (陶器) factory. The next week he told his family. They were horrified and worried. They thought he was too old at 71 to start work again.
  He is now 76 and he has expanded the company considerably. He has increased the number of staff from 6 to 24 and he has found many new customers for the products. He has developed the export market and has improved profits by 200%. He has opened a new design office and employed three young designers. They have been all over the world to get new ideas, and one of them has gone to France this week to a major trade fair. Most importantly, he hasn't been bored since he bought the factory.

> 摩根·里斯一直都是一个好商人。他曾经拥有三个加油站，大部分时间都很忙。当他65岁（正常退休年龄）时，他决定不想停下来，于是他又继续工作了两年。最终，当他快68岁时，他的妻子多莉（Dolly）要求他退休，因为她想一起享受他们的老年。他很不情愿地把生意交给了儿子。但是他不开心。他不知道该怎么办。尽管他读了很多书，并且和妻子一起去有趣的地方度假，但他很无聊，开始沮丧，因为他讨厌退休。然后有一天，他在报纸上看到一则广告，没有告诉妻子，就买了一家陶器厂。第二周他告诉家人。他们感到恐惧和担忧。他们以为他太高了71岁，无法重新开始工作。他现年76岁，他已经大大扩展了公司。他将员工人数从6增加到24，并且为产品找到了许多新客户。他开发了出口市场，利润提高了200％。他开设了一个新的设计办公室，并雇用了三名年轻设计师。他们已经在世界各地获得新的想法，其中一个已经于本周前往法国参加一次大型贸易展览会。最重要的是，自从他买下工厂以来，他再也不会觉得无聊。

> Two years ago, my husband left a bike for me. 
  If you live in a town, it is often faster than a car and don't have to worry about parking(停车). You can buy it anywhere. Because it has a seat at the back and a basket at the front, I can take my small daughter when it is cold and it is snowing hard. It also can be dangerous. You must be careful on a bike. Accidents are not the only problem. One day I went shopping and when I came back, I couldn't find my front wheel. It was a long walk to the bike shop! Now I have three strong locks.
  Sometimes my husband uses my bike for short trips. He is not good at riding bikes, but he says it is better than waiting for a bus. He still likes his car for longer trips, but I think that all this sitting down is making him fat. On my bike I got a lot of exercise and fresh air, and makes me feel much healthy. 

> 两年前，我丈夫为我留下了一辆自行车。如果您住在城镇，通常比开车要快，而且不必担心停车。您可以在任何地方购买。因为它在后面有一个座位，在前面有一个篮子，所以我可以带着我的小女儿在寒冷和下雪的时候去。这也很危险。您必须小心骑自行车。事故不是唯一的问题。有一天我去购物，回来的时候我找不到前轮。到自行车店很长的路！现在我有三个强力锁。有时我丈夫会用我的自行车短途旅行。他不擅长骑自行车，但他说，这比等公共汽车要好。他仍然喜欢长途旅行的汽车，但我认为坐下来的所有这些都使他发胖。骑自行车时，我锻炼了很多身体，呼吸了新鲜空气，让我感觉很健康。

#### 答案顺序
