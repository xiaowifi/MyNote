> On a practical level, teachers need a wide variety of skills and abilities. They have to be ready to spend many hours at home planning their lessons and preparing homework. They have to be well organized in class, patient with students, able to appear bright and interested even if they are in fact tired or unhappy, and lively enough to control a group of young people for almost 200 days a year. Outside the classroom, they may have to prepare teaching materials, to choose books to use as texts, to help organize the work of other teachers, or to organize spare time activities for students. 
  If you think that you have all the necessary qualities, you may feel that you would like to be a teacher. If you live in the United States, one way to decide is by joining a club for future teachers, such as Student Action for Education. Clubs like this give advice about your field, and also allow you to watch teachers at work, attend meetings and experiment with teaching methods and equipment. You could also talk with the job advisor at your school or university. Finally, you could try teaching a younger student or becoming an advisor at a summer camp for children. Any activity in which you are dealing with, children will help you decide whether you have a calling for teaching. 

> 在实践上，教师需要各种各样的技能和能力。他们必须准备好花很多时间在家计划课程并准备作业。他们必须在课堂上井井有条，对学生有耐心，即使他们实际上很累或不快乐，也要表现出开朗和兴趣，并且活泼得足以控制一群年轻人，一年近200天。在教室外面，他们可能必须准备教材，选择书籍作为课本，帮助组织其他教师的工作或组织学生的业余活动。如果您认为自己具备所有必要的素质，则可能会觉得自己想当老师。如果您居住在美国，那么一种决定方法是加入一个面向未来教师的俱乐部，例如“学生教育行动”。这样的俱乐部可以为您提供有关领域的建议，还可以让您观看工作中的老师，参加会议并尝试教学方法和设备。您也可以与学校或大学的求职顾问交谈。最后，您可以尝试在年龄较小的儿童的夏令营中教年轻的学生或成为顾问。孩子要从事的任何活动都会帮助您确定您是否有教书的呼吁。

* (T) A teacher should show a firm mind that is able to control tiredness and unhappiness,老师应该表现出坚强的心态和能够控制疲倦和不快乐
* (F) The first paragraph is mainly about how to plan lessons and prepare homework，第一段主要是关于如何计划课程和准备家庭作业
* (T) The second paragraph is about ways to decide whether teaching should be one's future employment 第二段是关于决定教学是否应作为未来工作的方式
* (F) Student Action for Education is an activity at a summer camp.学生教育行动是夏令营的一项活动
* (T) The author suggests that talking with job advisors will help you make decisions on taking a teaching job 作者建议与工作顾问交谈将帮助您做出从事教学工作的决策

> Today Newton is a very clean place. Many years ago, however, there were millions of rats in it. They attacked the cats and dogs. Sometimes a great number of them knocked down a man or woman walking home at night. The rats were very large in size and they harmed many people.
  The Government ordered everybody to kill rats. Most people were lazy, so they didn't kill many. The Government promised to pay some money for each dead rat. That made the people very happy. They killed thousands of rats everyday. A Government officer put all the dead rats in a big pile. Sometimes a man brought hundreds in one day.
  After two weeks there were not many rats in the city, but people still brought many rats to the Government office. The Government officer thought that people were stealing dad rats from the pile. He ordered his men to dig a deep hole and put the rats in it. Soon there were no more rats, and the Government didn't pay any more money.

> 今天牛顿是一个非常干净的地方。但是，许多年前，它里面有数百万只老鼠。他们袭击了猫和狗。有时，许多人击倒了一个晚上回家的男人或女人。老鼠很大，伤害了很多人。政府命令所有人杀老鼠。大多数人都是懒惰的，所以他们并没有杀死很多人。政府答应为每只死鼠支付一些钱。那使人们非常高兴。他们每天杀死数千只老鼠。一名政府官员将所有死老鼠大堆放。有时，一个人一天要带上几百把。两周后，城市里的老鼠不多了，但是人们仍然把很多老鼠带到了政府办公室。该政府官员以为人们正在从那堆老鼠里偷爸爸。他命令他的士兵们挖一个深洞并将老鼠放进去。很快就没有老鼠了，政府也不再付钱。
