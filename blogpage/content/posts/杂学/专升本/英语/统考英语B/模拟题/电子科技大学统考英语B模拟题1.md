> On a practical level, teachers need a wide variety of skills and abilities. They have to be ready to spend many hours at home planning their lessons and preparing homework. They have to be well organized in class, patient with students, able to appear bright and interested even if they are in fact tired or unhappy, and lively enough to control a group of young people for almost 200 days a year. Outside the classroom, they may have to prepare teaching materials, to choose books to use as texts, to help organize the work of other teachers, or to organize spare time activities for students. 
  If you think that you have all the necessary qualities, you may feel that you would like to be a teacher. If you live in the United States, one way to decide is by joining a club for future teachers, such as Student Action for Education. Clubs like this give advice about your field, and also allow you to watch teachers at work, attend meetings and experiment with teaching methods and equipment. You could also talk with the job advisor at your school or university. Finally, you could try teaching a younger student or becoming an advisor at a summer camp for children. Any activity in which you are dealing with, children will help you decide whether you have a calling for teaching. 

> 在实践层面上，教师需要各种各样的技能和能力。他们必须准备好花很多时间在家里计划功课和准备家庭作业。他们必须在课堂上组织得很好，对学生有耐心，即使他们实际上很累或不开心，也要表现得开朗和有兴趣，而且要活泼到能控制一个年轻人一年将近200天。在课堂之外，他们可能要准备教材，选择书籍作为课文，帮助组织其他老师的工作，或者组织学生的业余活动。
  如果你认为你具备所有必要的素质，你可能会觉得你想成为一名教师。如果你住在美国，一个决定的方法就是加入一个未来教师俱乐部，比如学生教育行动。像这样的俱乐部提供关于你所在领域的建议，也允许你在工作中观察老师，参加会议，试验教学方法和设备。你也可以和你学校或大学的就业顾问谈谈。最后，你可以尝试教一个年轻的学生或成为一个儿童夏令营的顾问。孩子们会帮助你决定你是否需要教书
* (T) A teacher should show a firm mind that is able to control tiredness and unhappiness,老师应该表现出坚强的心态和能够控制疲倦和不快乐
* (F) The first paragraph is mainly about how to plan lessons and prepare homework，第一段主要是关于如何计划课程和准备家庭作业
* (T) The second paragraph is about ways to decide whether teaching should be one's future employment 第二段是关于决定教学是否应作为未来工作的方式
* (F) Student Action for Education is an activity at a summer camp.学生教育行动是夏令营的一项活动
* (T) The author suggests that talking with job advisors will help you make decisions on taking a teaching job 作者建议与工作顾问交谈将帮助您做出从事教学工作的决策

> Many people who work in London prefer to live outside it, and to go in to their offices or schools every day by train, car or bus, even though this means they have to get up early in the morning and reach home late in the evening.  
  One advantage of living outside London is that houses are cheaper. Even a small flat in London without a garden costs quite a lot to rent. With the same money, one can get a little house in the country with a garden of one’s own.  
  Then, in the country one can really get away from the noise and hurry of busy working lives. Even though one has to get up earlier and spend more time in trains or buses, one can sleep better at night and during weekends and on summer evenings, one can enjoy the fresh, clean air of the country. If one likes gardens, one can spend one’s free time digging, planting, watering and doing the hundred and one other jobs which are needed in a garden. Then, when the flowers and vegetables come up, one has got the reward together with those who have shared the secret of Nature.  
  Some people, however, take no interest in country things: for them, happiness lies in the town, with its cinemas and theatres, beautiful shops and busy streets, dance-halls and restaurants. Such people would feel that their life was not worth living if they had to live it outside London. An occasional walk in one of the parks and a fortnight’s (two weeks) visit to the sea every summer is all the country they want: the rest they are quite prepared to leave to those who are glad to get away from London every night.  

> 许多在伦敦工作的人都喜欢住在伦敦以外的地方，每天都坐火车，汽车或公共汽车去办公室或学校，尽管这意味着他们必须清晨起床并在深夜回家。 。在伦敦以外居住的好处之一是房屋便宜。即使是伦敦没有花园的小公寓，租金也要高很多。只要用同样的钱，就可以在乡间拥有自己的花园的小房子。这样，在该国，人们便可以真正摆脱繁忙的工作环境中的喧嚣和匆忙。即使一个人必须早起，花更多的时间在火车或公共汽车上，一个人在晚上，周末和夏天的夜晚可以睡得更好，一个人可以享受这个国家清新的空气。如果您喜欢花园，则可以将自己的空闲时间花在挖，种，浇水上，以及完成花园中所需的一百一项工作。然后，当鲜花和蔬菜升起时，人们便与那些分享大自然秘密的人们一起获得了回报。但是，有些人对乡村事物不感兴趣：对他们而言，幸福在于镇上，那里有电影院和剧院，漂亮的商店和繁忙的街道，舞厅和餐馆。这样的人会觉得，如果不得不在伦敦以外的地方生活，那是不值得的。每年夏天，偶尔去其中一个公园散步，两周（两个星期）到海边逛逛，便是他们想要的整个国家：其余的游客准备好离开，准备每天晚上离开伦敦的人。
* People who work in London prefer to live in the country 在伦敦工作的人更喜欢住在这个国家
* renting a small flat without a garden 租一个没有花园的小公寓
* having spent time working in the garden  花时间在花园里工作
* their life was meaningless 他们的生活毫无意义
* escape from 从...逃脱

> Two years ago, my husband left a bike for me. 
  If you live in a town, it is often faster than a car and don't have to worry about parking(停车). You can buy it anywhere. Because it has a seat at the back and a basket at the front, I can take my small daughter when it is cold and it is snowing hard. It also can be dangerous. You must be careful on a bike. Accidents are not the only problem. One day I went shopping and when I came back, I couldn't find my front wheel. It was a long walk to the bike shop! Now I have three strong locks.
  Sometimes my husband uses my bike for short trips. He is not good at riding bikes, but he says it is better than waiting for a bus. He still likes his car for longer trips, but I think that all this sitting down is making him fat. On my bike I got a lot of exercise and fresh air, and makes me feel much healthy. 

> 两年前，我丈夫为我留下了一辆自行车。如果您住在城镇，通常比开车要快，而且不必担心停车。您可以在任何地方购买。因为它在后面有一个座位，在前面有一个篮子，所以我可以带着我的小女儿在寒冷和下雪的时候去。这也很危险。您必须小心骑自行车。事故不是唯一的问题。有一天我去购物，回来的时候我找不到前轮。到自行车店很长的路！现在我有三个强力锁。有时我丈夫会用我的自行车短途旅行。他不擅长骑自行车，但他说，这比等公共汽车要好。他仍然喜欢长途旅行的汽车，但我认为坐下来的所有这些都使他发胖。骑自行车时，我锻炼了很多身体，呼吸了新鲜空气，让我感觉很健康。
