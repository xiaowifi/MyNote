> Peter wondered why he didn't have many friends. The reason was he was always taking, never giving. 
  One day Peter told Bill, “I'd like to give a party on Saturday, I'd like you to come and bring Martha, too.”“Thanks, Peter. We'd be happy to come.”“Perhaps you'd like to bring your violin. You and Martha sing well together. I'm sure everyone will want you to sing for us.”That was how Peter began to plan his party. Next he asked another friend, Betty, to bring a cake.“You make the best cake in the world, Betty, and I like to eat your cake better than have one from the bakery.”Peter invited a few other friends to come to his party. He didn't forget to ask something from each one of them. He even asked Jim and Mary Jackson to let him give the party at their house! They agreed. 
  The party was a big success. However, as the guests were leaving, they said“Thank you ”to Bill and Martha for the music, Betty for the cake, the Jacksons for the use of the house and to others for their hard work. To Peter they just said,“Thanks for the invitation.”
 
> 彼得想知道为什么他没有很多朋友。原因是他一直在坚持，从不放弃。彼得有一天告诉比尔：“我想在周六参加一个聚会，我也希望你也来带玛莎。”“谢谢，彼得。我们很高兴来。”“也许您想带小提琴。你和玛莎在一起唱歌很好。我确定每个人都希望您为我们唱歌。”这就是彼得开始计划自己的聚会的方式。接下来，他请另一个朋友贝蒂（Betty）带上一块蛋糕：“贝蒂（Betty）是世界上最好的蛋糕，我比从面包店里买来的蛋糕还要好吃。”彼得邀请其他几个朋友来他的党。他没有忘记向他们每个人问一些问题。他甚至要求吉姆和玛丽·杰克逊让他在他们家举行聚会！他们同意了。聚会取得了很大的成功。然而，当客人们离开时，他们向比尔和玛莎说音乐，对贝蒂说是蛋糕，对杰克逊一家使用房子表示感谢，对其他人的辛勤工作表示感谢。他们对彼得说：“谢谢邀请。”

> Many people who work in London prefer to live outside it, and to go in to their offices or schools every day by train, car or bus, even though this means they have to get up early in the morning and reach home late in the evening.  
  One advantage of living outside London is that houses are cheaper. Even a small flat in London without a garden costs quite a lot to rent. With the same money, one can get a little house in the country with a garden of one’s own.  
  Then, in the country one can really get away from the noise and hurry of busy working lives. Even though one has to get up earlier and spend more time in trains or buses, one can sleep better at night and during weekends and on summer evenings, one can enjoy the fresh, clean air of the country. If one likes gardens, one can spend one’s free time digging, planting, watering and doing the hundred and one other jobs which are needed in a garden. Then, when the flowers and vegetables come up, one has got the reward together with those who have shared the secret of Nature.  
  Some people, however, take no interest in country things: for them, happiness lies in the town, with its cinemas and theatres, beautiful shops and busy streets, dance-halls and restaurants. Such people would feel that their life was not worth living if they had to live it outside London. An occasional walk in one of the parks and a fortnight’s (two weeks) visit to the sea every summer is all the country they want: the rest they are quite prepared to leave to those who are glad to get away from London every night.  


> 许多在伦敦工作的人都喜欢住在伦敦以外的地方，每天都坐火车，汽车或公共汽车去办公室或学校，尽管这意味着他们必须清晨起床并在深夜回家。 。在伦敦以外居住的好处之一是房屋便宜。即使是伦敦没有花园的小公寓，租金也要高很多。只要用同样的钱，就可以在乡间拥有自己的花园的小房子。这样，在该国，人们便可以真正摆脱繁忙的工作环境中的喧嚣和匆忙。即使一个人必须早起，花更多的时间在火车或公共汽车上，一个人在晚上，周末和夏天的夜晚可以睡得更好，一个人可以享受这个国家清新的空气。如果您喜欢花园，则可以将自己的空闲时间花在挖，种，浇水上，以及完成花园中所需的一百一项工作。然后，当鲜花和蔬菜升起时，人们便与那些分享大自然秘密的人们一起获得了回报。但是，有些人对乡村事物不感兴趣：对他们而言，幸福在于镇上，那里有电影院和剧院，漂亮的商店和繁忙的街道，舞厅和餐馆。这样的人会觉得，如果不得不在伦敦以外的地方生活，那是不值得的。每年夏天，偶尔去其中一个公园散步，两周（两个星期）到海边逛逛，便是他们想要的整个国家：其余的游客准备好离开，准备每天晚上离开伦敦的人。

* People who work in London prefer to live in the country  在伦敦工作的人更喜欢住在这个国家
* renting a small flat without a garden  租一个没有花园的小公寓
* having spent time working in the garden 花时间在花园里工作
* their life was meaningless 他们的生活毫无意义
* escape from 从...逃脱

> In the American family the husband and wife usually share important decision-making. 
> When the children are old enough, they take part as well. Foreigners are often surprised by the permissiveness (宽容) of American parents. 
> Children are often allowed to do pretty much what they wish without strict control by their parents. Children are encouraged to be independent at an early age. 
> Some people believe that American parents carry this freedom too far. Others think that a strong parental image would not suit American values. 
> Because Americans emphasize the importance of independence, young people are expected to break away from their families by the time they have reached their late teens or early twenties.
> This pattern of independence often raises serious problems for the aging parents of a small family. The average American is expected to live beyond the age of 70. The job-retirement age is usually 65. The children have left home, married, and set up their own households. Often the major problem of many elderly couples is not economic, but they feel useless and lonely with neither an occupation nor a close family ties.

> 当孩子们足够大时，他们也会参加。外国人经常对美国父母的宽容感到惊讶。 
> 经常允许孩子在父母没有严格控制的情况下做自己想做的事情。鼓励孩子们从小就独立。 
> 有些人认为，美国父母对这种自由的追求过高。其他人则认为，强大的父母形象不适合美国价值观。 
> 由于美国人强调独立的重要性，因此，预计年轻人会在十几岁或二十多岁时脱离家庭。 
>这种独立模式通常会给一个小家庭的老父母带来严重的问题。美国人的平均预期寿命将超过70岁。退休年龄通常为65岁。孩子们已经离开家，结婚并建立了自己的家庭。通常，许多老年夫妇的主要问题不是经济上的问题，但是他们既没有职业，也没有亲密的家庭关系，他们感到无用和孤独。

### 写作 
> Parents Are the Best Teachers
  内容需包括以下方面：
  1.你对“父母是最好的老师”的看法；
  2.举例说明你的观点。

#### 作文
Parents are the best teachers. Firstly, parents stay with children every day. Children will regard them as examples and learn from them. If the parents are polite, the children will be polite. Secondly, parents influence children with their words and behaviors. If parents always are nice to others and say good words about others, their children will also be kind to other children. If parents are good to old people, when the parents are getting older, the children will be good to them too. To sum up, from what has been discussed above we can draw the conclusion that parents are our best parents.

> 父母是最好的老师。首先，父母每天与孩子在一起。孩子们将把它们当作例子，并向他们学习。如果父母有礼貌，孩子就会有礼貌。其次，父母通过言语和行为影响孩子。如果父母总是对别人好，并且对别人说好话，那么他们的孩子也会对其他孩子也很友善。如果父母对老年人好，那么父母长大后，孩子也会对他们也好。综上所述，通过以上讨论，我们可以得出结论，父母是我们最好的父母。
