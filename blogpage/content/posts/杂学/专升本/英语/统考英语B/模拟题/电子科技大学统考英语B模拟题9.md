> Chess must be one of the oldest games in the world. An Arab traveller in India in the year 900 wrote that it was played 'long, long ago.' Chess was probably invented in India, and it has been played everywhere from Japan to Europe since 1400. The name 'chess' is interesting. When one player is attacking the other's king, he says in English, 'check'. When the king has been caught and cannot move anywhere, he says 'check mate'. These words come from Persian 'Shah mat' means 'the king is dead'. That is when the game is over, and one player has won.
  Such an old game changes very slowly. The rules have not always been the same as they are now. For example, at one time the queen could only move one square at a time. Now she is the strongest piece on the board. It would be interesting to know why this has happened. Chess takes time and thought, but it is a game for all kinds of people. You don't have to be a champion in order to enjoy it. It is not always played by two people sitting at the same table. The first time the Americans beat the Russians was in a match played by radio. Some of the chess masters are able to play many people at the same time. The record was when one man played 400 games! It is said that some people played chess by post. This must make chess the slowest game in the world.

> 国际象棋一定是世界上最古老的游戏之一。 900年一位印度的阿拉伯旅行者写道，这是“很久很久以前”播放的。国际象棋很可能是在印度发明的，自1400年以来，从日本到欧洲都在使用它。“ chess”这个名字很有趣。当一个玩家攻击另一个国王时，他用英语说“检查”。当国王被抓到并且无法动弹时，他说“检查伴侣”。这些词来自波斯语“ Shah mat”，意为“国王已死”。比赛结束时，一名玩家获胜。如此古老的游戏变化非常缓慢。规则并不总是与现在相同。例如，一次皇后一次只能移动一个方块。现在，她是董事会中最坚强的一员。知道为什么会发生这将很有趣。国际象棋需要时间和思想，但这是适合所有人群的游戏。您不必成为冠军就可以享受它。它并不总是由坐在同一张桌子上的两个人演奏。美国人第一次击败俄罗斯人是在广播比赛中。一些国际象棋大师可以同时玩很多人。记录是一个人玩了400场比赛！据说有人下棋。这必须使国际象棋成为世界上最慢的游戏。

> Once James Thornhill, a famous English painter, was asked to paint some pictures on the walls of the king's palace in England.
  Then workers were sent for and a big platform（台子）was made.
  With the help of a worker, Thornhill started painting on the platform. They worked for a whole year and at last the pictures were ready.
  Thornhill was happy when he looked at the pictures, for they were really beautiful. He looked at them for a long time, and then took one step back and looked again. Now the pictures were even more beautiful. He took another step, then another. Finally he was at the very edge of the platform, but he didn't know it because he was thinking of his pictures.
  The worker saw everything. "What should I do?" he thought. "Thornhill was at the very edge of the platform. If I cry out, he will take another step, fall off it and surely be killed. "So the worker quickly took some paint（漆）and threw it at the pictures.
  "What are you doing?" cried the painter, running quickly forward to his pictures.

If they take off their clothes and put them on the table, the people in the room will fall asleep and can't wake up.”
  When the thief heard this, he took off his clothes at once and was ready to set out to work. At this moment, the husband suddenly shouted in a loud voice:“Stop thief! Stop thief!” The thief was very frightened. He ran away as fast as be could and left his clothes on the table.
