### Smoking is harmful（吸烟有害）
Although people can see “Smoking is harmful to health” on the cigarette case, a lot of people still go on smoking and can not give it up.Undoubtedly, smoking is harmful to health. Lung cancer is mainly caused by cigarettes. Smoking is not only harmful to the smokers but also the people around them. This second-hand smoking may cause the same lung damage. At present, more and more young men even students start smoking at an early age, and this is not a good phenomenon. Therefore, I want to advise those people to give up smoking. Only giving it up can we keep healthy.

After the discussion we found that 60% of the students think they should take all kinds of exercise every day but not spend too much time, such as doing morning exercise, playing table tennis and basketball. They think exercise builds body and reduce the chance of disease. Sports also let them have a good rest so that their study will be more effective. On the other hand 40% students believe taking exercise is tiring and it’s a waste of time. They say that after having sports they are too excited for a long time to focus on their lessons. And it’s possible to get hurt during exercise.  In short, it’s good to exercise everyday, but overdoing it will bring harm to us.

First, too many private cars make the road crowded and cause traffic jams. Second, they pollute the air. Third, they cause a lot of traffic accidents. How can we solve these problems?

### Advantages and Disadvantages of the Mobile Phone（手机的利与弊）
My Opinion on Cell Phones  Like everything else, mobile phones have both favorable and unfavorable aspects.First, it's useful. As a wireless mobile telephone, it's easy and handy to call wherever one goes and call the one however far away he is. Second, it's convenient. Whenever one meets trouble or something urgent, one can make a call immediately.However, the mobile phone also has many disadvantages. First, it's expensive to buy and costly to pay the bills. Second, it's also easy to lose and costly to get it repaired. Third, it's alleged the microwaves in it might do harm to people's health.I believe its advantages will far outweigh disadvantages soon.

Nowadays, I can afford any delicious food, including western food. For housing, I moved from a cramped and gloomy room to a big and bright flat. For getting around, I rode an old bike on my way to work a year ago. At present, I drive my private car to travel. I believe my life will become better in the near future.

With the development of tourism, the campuses of many famous universities in China are open to the tourists. People have different opinions about it. Some people think that the tourists’ visit to the campus will make it harder for students to study. Worse still, it may cause some safety problems. However, others think that it can bring students and the society closer and is good for cultural exchange between people. In my opinion, several factors should be considered before opening the campuses to tourists. First, I suggest we should choose the universities with long history and beautiful campuses. Second, the campus should only be open to tourists on weekends or during holidays.
### On money（关于金钱）/ Money is not everything（金钱不是万能的）
Can Money Buy Happiness?A famous saying goes that “money is a good servant but a bad master.” Should we become its masters or its slaves?

We should think of money in a correct way and never do anything illegal in order to get money.

### Choosing a job（找工作）
Different people have different requirements of choosing a good job. Some think a decent salary is the most important factor while others regard training and experience to be the key factor.As far as I’m concerned, it’s more important to accumulate experience than get high salary. Rich experience offers people more opportunities to earn money. Besides, the more working experience you gain, the more competitive you will become. It makes people more confident. Therefore, it’s important to know yourself and find a job which brings you bright prospects.
### How to use a dictionary（如何使用字典）
When you are reading something in English, you may often come across a new word. What's the best way to know it? We should choose a good English-Chinese dictionary. It tells us the meaning of the English words in Chinese. When you meet a new word, don't use the dictionary at once. Try your best to think about what it means before you look it up in the dictionary. If you can't guess the meaning, look it up in the dictionary. If you use the dictionary as often as possible in your English learning, it will become your good friend.

It is near my company, so I can ride a bike to work everyday. During the weekends, I will do some housework and study English at home.I love my home. It is the best place ever.
### Failure is the mother of success（失败是成功之母）
All of us experience failure every now and then. Although some people will avoid failure at all costs, some people welcome it. Failure can be a good teacher. It always teaches us to be better the second time around. As they say, "The more you try, the more you'll succeed." There is some wisdom to be learned from failure.

### My view on luck（关于运气）
Nowadays many people believe in luck. They think luck can bring them everything. If they have good luck, they will be successful without hard work. But this is a wrong idea. As we all know, good luck does not come alone. Luck goes hand in hand with hard work. When a good chance comes to you, but you don’t work hard to complete the task, then you can’t grasp the chance, so good luck passes you by and leaves you. Therefore, people should work hard instead of depending on luck completely.
### Newspapers论报纸 
I read newspapers every day. As a student, I have no time to watch news programs on TV. Besides, watching television takes up a lot of time. So reading the newspaper becomes the only way for me to learn about what's happening around the world.There is an old Chinese saying, "A scholar need not leave his home to know what’s going on in the world." Thus, reading the newspaper is a must for those who wish to keep up with the times.
### Parents are the best teachers（父母是最好的老师）
Parents are the best teachers. Firstly, parents stay with children every day. Children will regard them as examples and learn from them. If the parents are polite, the children will be polite. Secondly, parents influence children with their words and behaviors. If parents always are nice to others and say good words about others, their children will also be kind to other children. If parents are good to old people, when the parents are getting older, the children will be good to them too. To sum up, from what has been discussed above we can draw the conclusion that parents are our best parents.
### Plant more trees（种更多的树）
April is the best time for green. Everything turns back to life in the warm weather and is enjoying the energy of a new life. Trees are more and more important to the earth.

### The way to success（成功的方法）
As we all know, not all people can make success in their lives. Most people will meet with failures on the way to success. Why do some people get successful in their lives?

Once they set up a goal, they will work hard to achieve it. Thirdly, they never easily quit. They always stick to their aims.I believe that where there is a will there is a way, and that success belongs to those who can make constant efforts.
### Water Pollution水污染/Water and Life 水与生活
Everybody knows that water pollution is a serious problem in the world. Lots of rubbish or chemical pollutants have been thrown in the rivers, lakes and seas. Many of them are getting dirtier and dirtier. Fish have died in the water, and people get sick after drinking polluted water. My grandfather says, when he was very little, the water in the river was very clean. He often swam in the river with his friends. But now we can’t see such clean rivers. Let’s protect the water from pollution, because we can’t live without water. The water is really important to us all.
