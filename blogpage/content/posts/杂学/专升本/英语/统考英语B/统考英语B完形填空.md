### More and more teachers
>  More and more teachers and parents have noticed another kind of pollution, which came from the printed papers sold on streets.
  There printed things look like newspaper but have hardly anything to do with them. You can only find reading material badly ___21___ there- some are too strange for anyone to believe, ___22___ are frightening stories of something even worse. However, many of the young students are getting absorbed in such poisonous reading, which costs them what they should pay for their breakfast and bring them nightmares and immoral ideas in return. Homework is left undone, daily games lost. 
  There sellers shout on streets selling their papers well. The writers, publishers and printers, ___23___ they are, we never know, are making their silent money. They sheep skinned wolf’s stories seem to have been forgotten once again.
  Why not forbid this kind of things at school?  Yes, both teachers and parents have asked each other for more strict control of the young readers. Yet unfortunately, ___24___ you want to forbid it, the more they want to have a look at it sometimes you may even find several children share one patched paper, which has travelled from one hand to another driven by the curious nature.
   It really does harm to our society. It has already formed a sort of moral pollution. The ___25___teachers and parents need more powerful support. Meanwhile, the young readers need more interesting books to help them get rid of these ugly papers.
  越来越多的老师和家长已经注意到另一种污染，即随街叫卖的印刷品。
  这些印刷品看起来像报纸，但又几乎跟报纸无关。 你只能看到这些阅读材料粗制滥造， 有些材料离奇得让人难以相信，其他的则是更糟糕的恐怖故事。然而，许多学生却迷上了这种有毒的读物， 他们把用于买早餐的钱拿来买这些，但带来的回报却是噩梦和不道德的思想。 家庭作业不做，整日沉迷于游戏。
  这些卖家在街上叫卖他们的报纸，销量很好。 我们从来不知道作家，出版商和印刷商是谁，但他们正默默赚着钱。披着羊皮的狼的故事似乎又被遗忘了。
  为什么学校不禁止这种事情呢? 是的，老师和家长都要求对方更加严格控制这些年轻的读者。 然而不幸的是， 你越是阻止，他们就越是想看。有时你甚至会发现好几个孩子争着看一张由于好奇心而穿来穿去的破报纸。
  这些劣质读物确实对我们的社会造成了危害。 它已经形成了一种道德污染。忧心的老师和家长需要更有力的支持。同时，这些小读者更需要更多有趣的书来帮助他们摆脱这些不健康的读物。

  当然，在我们这个小世界里，很有可能找到一个懂我们语言的人，但是，这对旅行者来说是退而求其次的做法。可以肯定的是，在不适用语言的情况下，他可以参观许多地方并看到许多事物，但是这额都不是这个国家的核心。为了从国家旅行中获得最大的益处， 懂得这个国家的语言对旅行者来说是非常重要的。

### Without time to relax and have fine
> Without time to relax and have fine, kids can suffer stress just like adults, warn exports-who say as many as one in four youngsters have symptoms of burnout (过度劳累).

Parents are in a panic because they know it’s ___23___world out there. They are running scared to be sure their kids can go into the marketplace and compete as adults, but ___24___ some cases they are missing the big picture.

Everyone needs time just to relax and refresh. When you’re not stressed, you can be ___25___ productive. That’s why it’s important to help your child find a balance.
  专家警告说， 如果没有时间放松， 没有娱乐， 还是会像大人一样感到过分的紧张。 据说，每四个孩子中就有一盒有过于疲劳的症状。越来越多的父母让孩子整天在严格安排的活动中忙碌。而这些孩子们的活动许多都富有竞争性， 而不是娱乐性的。孩子们不光被迫去参加，还要被迫去“取胜”，这就会造成过分的紧张。如今的父母认为，孩子如果不参加许多课外活动就会落后。父母很恐慌，因为他们知道现实生活是很残酷的。 他们十分紧张， 想让孩子长大后能够进入市场竞争。 但是在这种情况下， 他们会因小失大。
  从小不不幸福、性格抑郁的孩子长达后会不幸福，性格也会抑郁。这样的成人工作也干不好，生活也过不好。这类孩子不知道如何像成人那样放松自己。人人都需要时间放松、调整。 只有在你不紧张的时候才会更有创造力。因此帮助你的孩子保持身心平衡是很重要的

### Many students

The lecturer speaks for one or two hours, perhaps ____21__ the talk with slides，writing up important information on the blackboard, distributing reading material and giving out assignment．The new student sees the other students continuously writing on notebooks and ___22___ what to write.

  很多学生发现听大学的课程是一个很令人沮丧的经历。讲师连着讲一小时甚至是两小时，可能是配着幻灯片讲，写一些重要信息到黑板上，发一些阅读材料，布置一些作业。新生看见其他的学生不停地在笔记本上记着东西，很想知道他们到底在写什么。讲课结束后，学生经常是带着抓不到重点，无法理解的笔记离开教室。大多数学校都会提供一些课程，以帮助学生培养相关聆听和笔记技能。如果没有这些课的话，就会有很多有用的学习技巧指南，以帮助学生独立训练这些技能。任何情况下，在真正开始学习之前，解决这类问题是至关重要的。不得不承认，大多数学生在掌握大学要求的语言技能上，存在一定的困难。其中克服这些困难的一种方式是参加一整年语言和技能学习培训课。另外一种基本策略就是找一个学习同伴，可以互相指出困难，交流想法，互相帮助。

  第二次试验的时候，他们装载了乘客。因为乘客是一只公鸡、一只鸭子和一只绵羊，所以我们不知道他们对于那次飞行有什么感受。 但是，我们知道的是那次旅游持续了8分钟并且动物都安全的着陆了。

### can I have some money
> “Mom, can I have some money?” those are the words my mother used to hear all the time. In return, I heard, “why don’t you get a job?

My teachers were mad at me and yelled at me: why have a job? I missed a lot practice in football team and could only __23__back down at the match. My coach was cold at me with an unasked question: why have a job? I told them is was for the things I need, when actually it was or the things I wanted. Needing and wanting are different. Needing something is like your only shoes have holes in them. But wanting  us have every new brand sneaker just because you __24__ it. I start to think about if I did a wrong thing. Slowly, I learnt to manage my money better so that I could have more time for school and football. I learnt t make a wide __25__ on what I need and what I want.
  “妈妈，能给我一些钱吗？”这是我母亲过去经常听到的话，作为回应，我听到的是“你为什么不找个工作？虽然不快乐，但你可以有自己的钱，同时会获得一些尊重。”所以一年后，我找到工作。一周工作25个小时。5美元一小时， 在一家影楼做推销员。
  我得到这份工作后，我不得不同时踢足球，做作业和做工作， 这对我来水真的很难。我太疲倦了，学习上耽误了，很多功课不及格，我的老师对我很生气，并责骂我为什么找工作？足球队上，我也缺少了很多训练， 比赛垫底。我的教练很生气，又不禁问到，你为什么要工作？ 我告诉他们， 这我是我想要一些事物时，我需要做的。需要和想要是不同的。需要的东西就像是你唯一的一双鞋子破了个洞。 想要就是你因为喜欢，就想要很多鞋子。我开始思考我是不是做错了。 最后我学会了更好地管理钱，以便我有足够的时间做好学习的事情和踢足球。我学会了在需要和想要之间做正确的决定。

  很多人认同压力是现代生活的一个主要问题。很明确，担忧和争吵会导致各种疾病，从背疼到严重的头痛，甚至是更严重的病患，比如高血压。
  我们中有很多人认为压力是别人强加给我们的东西。我们经常抱怨别人如何给我们压力。但我们应该试图使这些压力不影响我们。我们不应忘记我们很大程度上自己在为自己制造压力。我们有时候接受了超过我们的身体和心理所能应付的工作。我们要学会接受自己的有限性。我们应该知晓什么东西真正重要，什么东西不重要。

### Modern zoos 
> Modern zoos are very different from zoos that were built fifty years ago. At that time, zoos were places   21   people could go to see animals from many parts of the world. The animals lived in cages that were made    22   concrete with iron bars, cages that were easy to keep clean. 
       Unfortunately for the animals, the cages were small and impossible to hide in. The zoo environment was anything but natural.   23   the zoo keepers took good care of the animals and fed them well, many of the animals did not thrive; they behaved in strange ways, and they often became ill.
       In modern zoos, people can see animals in more natural habitats. The animals are given more  24   in large areas so that they can live more comfortably as they would in nature. Even the appearance of zoos has changed. Trees and grass grow in the cages, and streams of water flow   25   the areas that animals live in.
  现代动物园与50年前的很不一样。50年前，动物园是可以看到世界各地动物的一个地方。动物们住在钢筋混凝土建造的笼子里，笼子容易清理。
      对于动物们很不幸的是，笼子太小无处可藏。动物园的环境一点也不天然。虽然动物园的员工照顾和喂养动物都很好，但动物们还是没有兴旺。他们行为怪异，常常生病。
      在现代动物园中，人们能够能够看到动物表现出更多天然的习性。人们给动物提供广阔的场地和更多的自由，所以动物们可以像在自然环境中一样舒适的生活。甚至连动物园的外观也进行了改善。笼子中种了树和草，小溪流过动物们居住的地方。

### holiday
> Three men came to London for a holiday. They came to a large hotel and took a room there. ___21___ room was on the fiftieth floor.
  In the evening the three men went to a cinema and came back very ___22___.
  “I'm sorry,” said the assistant of the hotel. “Our lifts are not working at this time of night. If you don't want to walk up to your room, we shall make up a bed for you in the hall.”
  “No, no,” Tom, one of the three men, said, “No, thank you. We do not want to sleep in the hall. We shall walk up to our room.”
  Then he turned to his two friends and said, “It is not easy to walk up to the fiftieth floor, but I know ___23___make it easier. On our way to the room, I shall tell you some jokes, then you, Andy, sing us some songs, then you, Peter, tell us some interesting stories.”
  “All right. That's a good idea,” the friends both agreed.
  They began to walk up to their room. Tom told many jokes. Andy sang some songs. ___24___ they came to the thirty-eighth floor. They were tired and decided to have a rest.
  “Well,” said Tom, “Now it's your turn, Peter. After all those jokes and songs, tell us a long and interesting story with a sad ending.” “All right,” said Peter, “I shall tell you a story. It is not long, ___25___ it is really sad: We left the key in our room in the hall.”
  有三个人来到英国去度假，他们来到一个非常大的旅馆，住在第四十五层。
  一天，他们去看电影很晚才回来。“很抱歉”旅馆服务员说“我们的电梯今晚坏了。”三人中的一个对另外两个朋友说“我们可以步行到房间，它很困难，但我想我知道怎样使它变得简单。在我们去房间的路上，我将将一些笑话，而你，约翰，给我们唱一首歌；而你，彼得，给我们将一些有趣的故事。”
  所以他们开始步行到他们的房间，汤姆将很多笑话，约翰唱很多歌，最后，他们来到那一层。他们很累，决定休息一下。
  “彼得你能不能告诉我们一个带着悲伤结局的真实故事？”汤姆说“我将告诉你一个悲伤的故事”彼得说，“它很短，但是足够是人伤心。就在刚才我们将钥匙落在楼下我们将怎么做？

### study names
> It’s very interesting to study names of different countries. Chinese names are different __21__ foreign names. Once an English lady came to visit me. When I was introduced to her, she said “Glad to meet you, Miss Ping.” Then she gave her name card with three words on it “Betty J.Black”. So I said “Thank you, Miss Betty.” We looked at each other and laughed heartily. Later I found that the English people __22__ their family name last and the given name first, while their middles are not used very much. I explained to her that the Chinese family name comes first, the given name last, so she __23__ never call me Miss Ping. She asked if we Chinese had a middle name. I told her we didn’t. But people may often find three words on a Chinese name card. In this case the family name still comes first and the other two words after it __24__ a two-word given name. It is quite usual in China. My sister is Li Xiaofang. She has two words in her given name instead __25__ just one like mine.
  学习不同国家人的名字其实是一件很有趣的事情。中国人的取名不同于外国人的取名。曾经， 有一个英国女士来访问我。 我做完自我介绍后，她打招呼道：“萍小姐，很高兴见到你。” 然后她给我她的名片，上面写着“Betty J.Black”。因此我同道“谢谢，贝蒂小姐。”我们看着彼此，不禁笑起来。之后，我发现原来英国人的姓氏都放在名字之后，而中间的名字并不常用。我向他解释道， 中国人的姓名都是姓氏在前，名字在后。所以她不应该叫我萍小姐。 她问我们中国人是否有中间名， 我告诉她我们没有。 但是人们通常会发现中国人的名片上有时候会出现三个字。 在这种情况下，姓氏放在首位， 后面的两个字都是名字。这在中国是很常见的，我姐姐的姓名就叫 李晓芳，名字有两个字，而不像我的只有一个。

### thirsty for water
> The world is not only hungry; it is also thirsty for water. This may seem strange to you, since nearly 75% of the earth's surface is covered with water. But about 97% of this huge  21  is seawater, or salt water. Man can only drink and use the other 3% of the fresh water that comes from rivers, lakes, underground, and other   22  . And we can't even use all of that, because some of it is in the form of icebergs and glaciers. Even worse, some of it has been polluted. However, as things stand today, this small amount of fresh water,  23  is constantly being replaced by rainfall; is still enough for us. But our need for water is increasing rapidly－almost day by day. We all have to learn how to stop wasting our  24 water. One of the first steps we should take is to develop ways of reusing it. Experiments have already been done in this  25 , but only on a small scale. The systems that have been worked out resemble those used in spacecraft.
  世界不仅仅饥饿，还很渴。你可能觉得这很奇怪，因为近75%的地球表面都覆盖着水。但是96%的水都是海水或咸水。人们只能饮用和使用其他3%的来自河湖、地下与其他来源的淡水。我们甚至连这些也不能都利用，因为有的存在于冰山和冰川里。更糟糕的是，一些水还被污染了。但是，正如今天的情况一样，这些少量的淡水，在不停地由降雨循环，现在还够我们使用。但我们对水的需求在增加，几乎是每天都在增加。我们都必须学会如何不浪费宝贵的水。我们可做的第一步中，开发重复利用水的技术是一项。这一领域，已做了很多实验，但只是小规模的。开发的系统很像飞行器上的用的那种。

### consumer behavior
> Scientists have studied consumer behavior recently and found that the look of the package has a great effect___21__ the “quality” of the product and on how well it sells, because “consumers generally cannot tell between a product and its package. Many products are packages and many packages are products, ’’ as Louis Cheskin, the first social scientist studying consumers’ feeling for packaging, noticed.”
     Colors are one of the best tools in packaging. Studies of eye movement have shown that colors draw human___22__ quickly. Take V8 for example. For many years, the bright red color of tomatoes and carrots on the thin bottle makes you feel that it is very good for your body. And the word “green” today can keep food prices___23__. Shapes are another attraction. Circles often suggest happiness and peacefulness, because these shapes are pleasing to both the eye and the heart. That’s___24__   the round yellow M signs of McDonald’s are inviting to both young and old.
  This new consumer response to the colors and shapes of packages remains producers and sellers that people ___25__  to satisfy both body and soul.
  科学家们最近研究了顾客行为，发现包装的外观极大地影响了对商品质量的判断以及商品的销量，因为“顾客一般辨认不出商品与包装。很多商品是包装好了的，很多包装本身就是商品。”首个研究包装带给顾客感受的社会科学家路易斯•彻斯金发现。
  颜色是商品包装的一个制胜法宝。对眼睛移动的研究显示，颜色能快速吸引人的注意力。以V8为例。很多年来，西红柿和胡萝卜的鲜艳的红色映在细小的瓶子上，让你感觉到这个对你身体很有好处。而今天“绿色“这个词可以是食物价格大幅度上涨。形状是另一个关键。圆形象征着幸福、和平，因为这些形状既对你的眼睛又对你的心脏有好处。那就是为什么麦当劳M是黄色的圆圆的字体既可以吸引年轻人又可以吸引老人。
  顾客对包装的颜色以及形状的反应，依然是生产商和销售商来满足顾客身体和心灵需求的主要方式。
