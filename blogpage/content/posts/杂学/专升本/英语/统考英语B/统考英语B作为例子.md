My favorite book is A Dream of Red Mansions. It was written by Cao Xueqin. The book tries to tell us that there are different kinds of love, only one kind which should be considered as True Love. In our life, we should marry the true love instead of wealth and good looks. From this book, we also get to know a part of the noble people’s life in Qing Dynasty and find some life philosophies from it. This book is very instructive to people. I can learn a lot from this book. So it is my favorite book.
